        <h2>Core Java By. Cay Horstman</h2>
        <div>In late 1995, the Java programming language burst onto the Internet scene and gained instant
            celebrity status. The promise of Java technology was that it would become the universal glue that
            connects users with information wherever it comes from—web servers, databases, information
            providers, or any other imaginable source. Indeed, Java is in a unique position to fulfill this promise.
            It is an extremely solidly engineered language that has gained acceptance by all major vendors, except
            for Microsoft. Its bui-lt-in security and safety features are reassuring both to programmers and to the
            users of Java programs. Java even has built-in support for advanced programming tasks, such as
            network programming, database connectivity, and multithreading.
            <p>Since 1995, eight major revisions of the Java Development Kit have been released. Over the
            course of the last 17 years, the Application Programming Interface (API) has grown from about 200 to
            over 3,000 classes. The API now spans such diverse areas as user interface construction, database
            management, internationalization, security, and XML processing.</p>
            The book you have in your hands is the first volume of the ninth edition of Core Java
            ™. Each edition closely followed a release of the Java Development Kit, and each time, we rewrote the book
            to take advantage of the newest Java features. This edition has been updated to reflect the features of
            Java Standard Edition (SE) 7.
            <p>As with the previous editions of this book, we still target serious programmers who want to put
            Java to work on real projects. We think of you, our reader, as a programmer with a solid background
            in a programming language other than Java, and we assume that you don’t like books filled with toy
            examples (such as toasters, zoo animals, or “nervous text”). You won’t find any of these in our book.
            Our goal is to enable you to fully understand the Java language and library, not to give you an illusion
            of understanding.</p>
            In this book you will find lots of sample code demonstrating almost every language and library
            feature that we discuss. We keep the sample programs purposefully simple to focus on the major
            points, but, for the most part, they aren’t fake and they don’t cut corners. They should make good
            starting points for your own code.

       <h2>Reviews</h2>
       <div><ol><li>
        <p>Core Java, Volume 1: Fundamentals by Cay S. Horstmann - is the most advised book by mentors for all android and java developers, and at the same time is the driest literature I have ever read.
            I believe that the space shuttle flight manual would be easier to read.
            In addition, I cannot understand what so special about this book as half of the information in it is outdated and useless.</p></li>
            <li><p>Incredibly detailed overview of the capabilities of the Java language. A bit overwhelming at times, but finds focus with several code examples. I'd recommend Head First Java as your first Java book, but if you're looking for a more contemporary look at the language, this is a great next book.</p></li>
            <li><p>Java To The CORE<br/>
