        <h2>Java Cookbook by John Keller</h2>
        <div>This chapter will give you an appreciation of what the Java language is all about. Understanding
            the details of what I’ll discuss in this chapter is not important at this stage; you will see all of the
            topics again in greater depth in later chapters of the book. The intent of this chapter is to introduce
            you to the general ideas that underpin what I’ll be covering through the rest of the book, as well as
            the major contexts in which Java programs can be used and the kind of program that is applicable
            in each context.

       <h2>Reviews</h2>
       <div><ol><li>
        <p>It the most advised book by mentors for all android and java developers, and at the same time is the driest literature I have ever read.
            I believe that the space shuttle flight manual would be easier to read.
            In addition, I cannot understand what so special about this book as half of the information in it is outdated and useless.</p></li>
            <li><p>Incredibly detailed overview of the capabilities of the Java language. A bit overwhelming at times, but finds focus with several code examples. I'd recommend Head First Java as your first Java book, but if you're looking for a more contemporary look at the language, this is a great next book.</p></li>

                What's great about this book is that it doesn't just cover the basics of Java, but it goes into detail on some more advanced topics as well.<br/>
                I appreciated the author's approach of starting with the fundamentals and building upon them to help readers gain a deeper understanding of Java programming.<br/>
